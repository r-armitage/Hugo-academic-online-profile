Rhiannon Mae Armitage is a Doctoral Researcher in the School of Psychology at the University of Sussex.

Her PhD focuses on understanding the genetic and neural basis of individual differences in liking for sweet tastes as a marker of risk for the development of obesity and consequent type-2 diabetes. 

She is also actively working on multisensory projects, including elucidating the behavioural and neural basis of odour-taste associations and utilises micro-phenomenological interviews to explore and understand people's individual experiences of the sensory world.
